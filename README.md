## Introduction

This project provides implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript, similar to the Java Collection framework. The implemented data structures include:

- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack
- HashMap
- Heap
- Graph

These data structures are fundamental for solving a wide range of computational problems efficiently.

## Data Structures Implemented

### Array

JavaScript's built-in `Array` is used, which provides a dynamic, resizable array.

### LinkedList

A custom implementation of a singly linked list.

### Stack

A stack implemented using JavaScript's `Array` to provide LIFO (Last In First Out) functionality.

### HashMap

JavaScript's `Map` object is used to store key-value pairs.

### Heap

A min-heap implementation using an array to store elements in a specific order.

### Graph

A graph data structure implemented using adjacency lists with JavaScript's `Map`.
